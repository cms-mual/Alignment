### Run alignment on Data

The following commands can be used to process the muon alignment in data.  
_NB: for CSC, the `--T0` option is not needed._

```

                --gprcd IdealGeometry --is_Alca --T0

# CSC
./createJobs.py data_CSC-1100-100001_2017B_CMSSW925p2_SingMu_MuAlCalIsoMuv1_92XdataRun2Promptv5_ 1 data_CSC-1100-110001_SingleMuon_Run2016G_MuAlCalIsolatedMu_278820_280385_8_0_24_Rerecov1_03.db \

                --gprcd IdealGeometry --is_Alca
```

Once the new shell script is created, simply execute the shell script to run the muon alignment.  
_The new shell script should have the same name as the `-s` argument in the command above: 'data_DT-1100-111111_2017B_CMSSW925p2_SingMu_MuAlCalIsoMuv1_92XdataRun2Promptv5_T0.sh'_

## Batch Job Monitoring

Many batch jobs are submitted to successfully run the muon alignment.
New additions to the framework allow the user to check the (many) batch job outputs to determine if there
were any failures that need to be re-submitted.

New scripts in `MuonAlignmentAlgorithms/scripts/`:

Script | Description
------ | -----------
`createBatchJobs.py`    | Create batch jobs.  This mimics the setup above, but is still being developed.
`writeBatchScripts.py`  | Class that contains information for writing batch scripts automatically.
`submitBatchJobs.py`    | Submit batch jobs.  Recommended method because it saves the LSF ID with the script that was submitted.
`configuration.py`      | Configuration class.  Necessary for creating/submitting/monitoring batch jobs.
`util.py`               | Utility functions used in the framework.
`runBatchJobMonitor.py` | Running script that uses the `batchJobMonitor` class.
`batchJobMonitor.py`    | Class responsible for performing the tasks to determine if a batch job failed.

Using the setup described above (with `createJobs.py`), submit batch jobs to run the muon alignment.
If you submit jobs by just executing the batch script, the batch monitoring tool can still determine which jobs have failed,
but it will not be able to link failed batch jobs with the script that was executed.  
Instead, it is recommended to create batch jobs using the setup above, and use the `submitBatchJobs.py` script to submit the jobs.

To do this, simply:
```
./createJobs.py ... # described above
python submitBatchJobs.py config.txt
```
where `config.txt` is a configuration file that contains arguments similar to the command line arguments above.
An example is located in `MuonAlignmentAlgorithms/scripts/config.txt`.  
The `name` and `iterations` arguments are the only necessary configuration settings for submitting batch jobs.  
_(In the above command, 'name' = 'data_DT-1100-111111_2017B_CMSSW925p2_SingMu_MuAlCalIsoMuv1_92XdataRun2Promptv5_T0' 
and 'iterations' is the number of iterations to run, the second argument in the above commands.)_

Once the batch jobs have been submitted, the LSF ID numbers and corresponding scripts are saved to a file.  
To check the successes or failures of batch jobs, run the following command:

```
python runBatchJobMonitor.py config.txt
```

The failed jobs will be saved to a text file (for reference later) and also printed to the screen.
Check the `STDOUT` files from the LSF jobs to make sure the jobs actually failed!
Jobs can be re-submitted by the user.  
_There is temporary functionality built-in to the batchJobMonitor to automatically resubmit jobs, 
but it is not currently active_.

Please investigate the `batchJobMonitor` class and `runBatchJobMonitor` script to check other options and configurations.


## Notes for the changing CMSSW release

For new releases of CMSSW, it is important to keep relevant code up-to-date.
Currently, the muon alignment framework relies on CMSSW packages that aren't centrally maintained,
but need to remain consistent with the official release.  

First, get the correct architecture, checkout the release, if needed, as described above.  
Compare your local repository with the official CMSSW release.  

The repositories that need to be checked are:

- TrackingTools
- Alignment/CommonAlignmentMonitor
- Alignment/MuonAlignmentAlgorithms

Directly compare your repository with the release using these commands:
```
diff -r $CMSSW_BASE/src/TrackingTools/TrackRefitter/ $CMSSW_RELEASE_BASE/src/TrackingTools/TrackRefitter/ > diff_TrackingTools.txt
```
In `TrackingTools` there should have only be one file with differences (where hits in muon system are neglected, and you do the fit 3 times).  
Next, check the `CommonAlignmentMonitor`:
```
diff -r $CMSSW_BASE/src/Alignment/CommonAlignmentMonitor/ $CMSSW_RELEASE_BASE/src/Alignment/CommonAlignmentMonitor/ > diff_CommonAlignmentMonitor.txt
```
This package should be identical.  
_For some reason this package must be mainted in `cms-mual`, so just check your version is identical to the one in CMSSW._

Finally, the `MuonAlignmentAlgorithms` package needs to be checked.
```
 diff -r $CMSSW_BASE/src/Alignment/MuonAlignmentAlgorithms/ $CMSSW_RELEASE_BASE/src/Alignment/MuonAlignmentAlgorithms/ > diff_MuonAlignmentAlgorithms.txt
```

There should be many dfferences here!  
Check one by one if they are expected! If you are unsure if changes are expected,
it is easiest to compare the two CMSSW releases and see what changes you need to propagate (rather than sifting through `diff_MuonAlignmentAlgorithms.txt`).
```
export OLDRELEASE=CMSSW_9_4_0
diff -r $CMSSW_RELEASE_BASE/src/Alignment/MuonAlignmentAlgorithms/  /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/slc6_amd64_gcc630/cms/cmssw-patch/$OLDRELEASE/src/Alignment/MuonAlignmentAlgorithms/ > diff_MuonAlignmentAlgorithms.txt
# you may need to change the path to the old release, depending on CMSSW development.
```
